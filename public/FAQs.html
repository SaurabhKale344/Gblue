          <p class="article5-body-paragraph">
            AdBlue, also known as Diesel Exhaust Fluid (DEF), is a vital
            component in modern diesel engines equipped with Selective Catalytic
            Reduction (SCR) systems. Its role in reducing harmful emissions is
            crucial for meeting stringent environmental standards. This article
            answers common FAQs to help you understand why diesel engines need
            AdBlue and how it benefits both your vehicle and the environment.
          </p>

          <h2 class="article5-section-title">1. What is AdBlue?</h2>
          <p class="article5-body-paragraph">
            AdBlue is a non-toxic, colorless liquid made up of 32.5% urea and
            67.5% deionized water. It is injected into the exhaust stream of
            diesel engines equipped with SCR technology to reduce nitrogen oxide
            (NOx) emissions.
          </p>
          <h2 class="article5-section-title">
            2. Why is AdBlue Necessary for Diesel Engines?
          </h2>
          <p class="article5-body-paragraph">
            AdBlue is essential for modern diesel engines to meet stringent
            emission standards. NOx gases produced by diesel engines are harmful
            to human health and the environment. AdBlue, when combined with SCR
            technology, converts these harmful gases into harmless nitrogen and
            water vapor, significantly reducing pollution.
          </p>

          <h2 class="article5-section-title">3. How Does AdBlue Work?</h2>
          <p class="article5-body-paragraph">
            AdBlue is injected into the exhaust system, where it reacts with NOx
            gases in the SCR catalyst. The chemical reaction breaks down NOx
            into nitrogen (a harmless gas) and water vapor, thus reducing
            emissions effectively.
          </p>
          <h2 class="article5-section-title">
            4. Which Vehicles Require AdBlue?
          </h2>
          <p class="article5-body-paragraph">
            Vehicles with SCR systems will require AdBlue for proper operation.
            AdBlue is used in a wide range of diesel vehicles, including:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Trucks and buses</li>
            <li>Diesel Passenger cars</li>
            <li>Agricultural machinery</li>
            <li>Construction equipment</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 class="article5-section-title">
            5. How Often Do I Need to Refill AdBlue?
          </h2>
          <p class="article5-body-paragraph">
            A typical diesel engine needs enough AdBlue to match 4-6% of the
            amount of diesel it uses. In other words, the engine needs 4-6
            litres of AdBlue for every 100 litres of fuel it consumes. AdBlue
            consumption is quite consistent and predictable, making it easy for
            you to forecast how much you need regularly.
          </p>
          <h2 class="article5-section-title">
            6. What Happens if My Vehicle Runs Out of AdBlue?
          </h2>
          <p class="article5-body-paragraph">
            Your vehicle may enter a limp mode, restricting performance. Most
            modern vehicles will not restart until AdBlue is refilled. Increased
            emissions, which could result in regulatory penalties. Always refill
            AdBlue before it runs out to avoid these problems.
          </p>

          <h2 class="article5-section-title">
            7. Can I Use Water or Other Fluids Instead of AdBlue?
          </h2>
          <p class="article5-body-paragraph">
            No. AdBlue is specifically formulated to work with SCR systems.
            Using water or other substitutes can damage your vehicle‚Äôs SCR
            system, increase emissions, and void your warranty. Always use
            certified AdBlue that meets ISO 22241 standards.
          </p>
          <h2 class="article5-section-title">8. Does AdBlue Expire?</h2>
          <p class="article5-body-paragraph">
            Yes, AdBlue has a shelf life of about one year if stored correctly.
            It should be kept in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight and
            extreme temperatures. Degraded AdBlue can affect your vehicle‚Äôs
            performance and SCR system.
          </p>

          <h2 class="article5-section-title">
            9. Is AdBlue Harmful or Dangerous?
          </h2>
          <p class="article5-body-paragraph">
            AdBlue is non-toxic and safe to handle. However, it can be corrosive
            to certain metals and materials. If it spills on your skin, wash it
            off with water. Avoid ingesting or inhaling AdBlue.
          </p>
          <h2 class="article5-section-title">
            10. Can I Reuse AdBlue from Roadside Containers?
          </h2>
          <p class="article5-body-paragraph">
            It is not recommended to use AdBlue from roadside IBC tanks or
            containers of unknown quality. Counterfeit or contaminated AdBlue
            can damage your SCR system. Always purchase AdBlue from trusted
            suppliers.
          </p>
          <h2 class="article5-section-title">11. How Can I Store AdBlue?</h2>
          <p class="article5-body-paragraph">
            To ensure AdBlue remains effective:<br />

            Store it in a cool, dry place between -11¬∞C and 30¬∞C. Keep it in
            sealed, opaque containers to protect it from sunlight. Avoid
            contamination by keeping storage areas clean.
          </p>

          <h2 class="article5-section-title">12. Is AdBlue Expensive?</h2>
          <p class="article5-body-paragraph">
            The cost of AdBlue is relatively low compared to its benefits. While
            prices vary, it is a small expense for maintaining regulatory
            compliance and reducing emissions.In India, cost is around
            65/litre,pretty much same of all companies.
          </p>
          <h2 class="article5-section-title">
            13. How Do I Know If AdBlue is Working?
          </h2>
          <p class="article5-body-paragraph">
            Your vehicle‚Äôs onboard diagnostics system monitors AdBlue usage and
            SCR performance. If there‚Äôs an issue, a warning light or message
            will appear on your dashboard.
