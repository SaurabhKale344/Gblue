            AdBlue is a type of diesel exhaust fluid (DEF) that reduces the
            amount of harmful nitrogen oxides (NOx) emitted by a diesel engine.
            The colourless, non-toxic liquid is stored in separate AdBlue tanks
            and injected directly into the exhaust streams, making it neither an
            additive nor a fuel.
          </p>

          <h2 class="article1-section-title">What is AdBlue?</h2>

          <ul>
            <li>
              AdBlue is a non-toxic, colorless, odorless, and non-flammable
              fluid that's injected into the exhaust system of diesel vehicles
              to reduce harmful emissions.
            </li>

            <li>
              AdBlue is a mixture used in all heavy-duty diesel engines produced
              ‚Äì primarily Euro 6-compliant models. AdBlue is not a fuel additive
              as it ºs added to the exhaust gas after combustion has taken place.
            </li>
            <li>
              By regulating vehicular NOx emissions and advocating for AdBlue
              usage, governments worldwide are promoting cleaner air and
              safeguarding against the health risks associated with diesel
              pollution.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2 class="article1-section-title">What Is AdBlue Made Of?</h2>
          <p class="article1-body-p">
            AdBlue is a colourless mixture of highly-purified adBlue grade urea
            (32.5%) and highly-purified pharmaceutical grade deionised water
            (67.5%).The urea in AdBlue contains ammonia, which is the active
            ingredient that reacts with and neutralizes NOx before it enters the
            atmosphere.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong> Deionized Water (67.5%): </strong>
              The water used in DEF is deionized to remove any minerals, salts,
              or impurities that could potentially damage the Selective
              Catalytic Reduction (SCR) system or reduce its effectiveness.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Urea (32.5%):</strong>
              The urea used in AdBlue is highly purified and derived
              synthetically. It is a nitrogen-based compound (chemical formula
              CO(NH‚ÇÇ)‚ÇÇ) that, when heated in the SCR system, breaks down into
              ammonia (NH‚ÇÉ)
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2 class="article1-section-title">How does AdBlue work?</h2>

          </div>
          <p class="article1-body-p">
            AdBlue is a high purity, 32.5% urea solution directly injected into
            the exhaust gas where it serves as reducing agent. The released
            ammonia subsequently reacts with the nitric oxides on the catalyst
            to form elementary nitrogen and water; both are natural constituents
            of the air we breathe. Hence, the amount of nitric oxides in the
            emission can be reduced.
          </p>

          <h2 class="article1-section-title">
            What happens if I run out of Adblue?
          </h2>

          <p class="article1-body-p">
            If you run out of AdBlue while you‚Äôre driving, then the engine‚Äôs
            power and performance will be reduced to limit its emissions. Once
            you‚Äôve stopped, you won‚Äôt be able to restart the engine if the
            AdBlue tank‚Äôs empty. The car will give you plenty of warning that
            the AdBlue tank is running low. You'll usually see a text warning on
            the dashboard when there's around 1500 miles' worth of AdBlue left.
          </p>

          <h2 class="article1-section-title">
            How much AdBlue does my car use and how long does it last?
          </h2>

          <p>
            A typical diesel engine needs enough AdBlue to match 4-6% of the
            amount of diesel it uses. In other words, the engine needs 4-6
            litres of AdBlue for every 100 litres of fuel it consumes. AdBlue
            consumption is quite consistent and predictable, making it easy for
            you to forecast how much you need regularly.
          </p>
          <h2 class="article1-section-title">
            What is the Adblue warning light?
          </h2>
          <p>
            The Adblue warning light is an indicator on your car‚Äôs dashboard. It
            signals when Adblue levels are low and is usually accompanied by a
            milage countdown. When the light is on your car‚Äôs Adblue tank needs
            to be refilled to maintain proper emissions control. It‚Äôs important
            to address this warning, because failure to refill the tank may lead
            to your vehicle going into reduced power mode and in some cases the
            car won‚Äôt start. You‚Äôll need to switch it off to restart it.
          </p>
          <h2 class="article1-section-title">
            Is it safe to drive with the AdBlue warning light on?
          </h2>
          <p>
            It‚Äôs not a major safety issue, but if you don‚Äôt top up, you‚Äôll
            eventually run out of AdBlue and you won‚Äôt be able to start the car.
            When the warning light first comes on you‚Äôll have plenty of time to
            refill.
          </p>

          <h2 class="article1-section-title">
            What happens if I put AdBlue in the diesel tank?
          </h2>
          <p>
            Putting it directly into your fuel tank could cause expensive damage
            to your fuel tank, pump and injection system. If you start the
            engine it's likely to be an expensive write-off, so don‚Äôt touch the
            ignition. You‚Äôll need to get the tank drained and the contents
            disposed of safely before you can refill it.
