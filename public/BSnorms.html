            The Bharat Stage (BS) norms are emission standards introduced by the
            Indian government to regulate the output of air pollutants from
            vehicles. They play a crucial role in improving air quality and
            reducing environmental damage caused by vehicular emissions.
          </p>
          <p class="article1-body-p">
            These standards, based on the European emission norms, aim to reduce
            harmful pollutants released from vehicles and improve air quality.
          </p>
          <h2 class="article1-section-title">What are BS Norms?</h2>
          <p class="article1-body-p">
            BS norms are akin to the Euro emission standards followed in Europe.
            They set permissible limits for pollutants like carbon monoxide
            (CO), nitrogen oxides (NOx), hydrocarbons (HC), and particulate
            matter (PM) emitted by vehicles. The higher the stage (e.g., BS4,
            BS6), the stricter the limits on emissions.The Bharat Stage Norms
            were first introduced in the year 2000, and the standards have been
            progressively tightened over the years to reduce the emission of
            harmful pollutants. Currently, the Bharat Stage 6 (BS-VI) norms are
            being implemented nationwide, representing a significant leap
            towards cleaner air in the country. The implementation of the BS-VI
            norms has had a major impact on the automotive industry, requiring
            manufacturers to make significant investments in technology and R&D
            to meet the stricter emission requirements.
          </p>
          <h2 class="article1-section-title">
            Current Emission Standards in India
          </h2>
          <p class="article1-body-p"></p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The current emission standard in India requires that all new cars
              produced, sold, and registered in India as of April 1, 2020,
              comply with the BS-VI norms.
            </li>
            <li>
              Particulate matter (PM 2.5) emissions from BS-VI engines range
              from 20 to 40 micrograms per cubic meter.
            </li>
            <li>
              The amount of sulphur released into the atmosphere by
              BS-VI-compliant engines was reduced five times, from 50 ppm to 10
              ppm.
            </li>
            <li>
              In diesel engines, nitrogen oxide emissions would be reduced by
              70%, and in petrol engines, by 25%. Reduced fuel combustion would
              result in less incomplete fuel combustion-related hydrocarbon
              emission.
            </li>
            <li>
              Three new types of equipment will be fixed in the vehicles by the
              car manufacturer to reduce emissions:
              <ul>
                <li>Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF)</li>
                <li>Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) system</li>
                <li>Lean NOx Trap (LNT)</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              Real Driving Emission (RDE) will be introduced in India for the
              first time to measure a vehicle's emission under real conditions.
            </li>
            <li>
              Onboard Diagnostics (OD) has been made compulsory for all
              automobiles.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2 class="article1-section-title">Significance of BS-VI Norms</h2>
          <p class="article1-body-p">
            The BS 6 (Bharat Stage 6) emission norms represent a significant
            leap in India's efforts to combat air pollution and improve public
            health.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The fact that the air quality in Indian cities is getting worse is
              largely due to vehicle emissions. NOx, SO2, CO2, and particulate
              matter emissions are negatively impacting people's health. Cities
              like Delhi have PM2.5 levels more than six times higher than the
              World Health Organization (WHO) recommends. These new regulations
              will drastically lower vehicle emissions
            </li>
            <li>
              The difference between diesel and petrol emissions, wherein diesel
              vehicles are permitted to emit more particulate matter and
              nitrogen oxide, narrows under the BS-VI norms

            All the technologies and emission control measures from earlier
            Bharat Stage (BS) standards are still present in BS6, but they have
            been significantly refined and enhanced to meet stricter emission
            limits. Features such as catalytic converters, fuel injection
            systems, and exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) systems, introduced in
            earlier BS norms, continue to exist in BS6 with advanced versions
            like diesel particulate filters (DPF) and selective catalytic
            reduction (SCR) systems. Even if newer emission standards like BS7
            are introduced, BS6 will still form the foundation, as the
            fundamental principles of controlling vehicle emissions will remain
            the same. Moreover, European and American regulatory bodies have
            already indicated that with current technology, there is limited
            room for further drastic improvements in emission control.
          </p>
          <h2 class="article1-section-title">Conclusion</h2>
          <p>
            The implementation of BS 6 norms marks a critical advancement in
            India ºs fight against air pollution. By significantly reducing
            emissions of harmful pollutants such as NOx and particulate matter,
            these norms have already contributed to cleaner air and improved
            public health. The shift towards BS 6 has driven the adoption of
            advanced vehicle technologies, setting a strong foundation for
            future environmental policies. Looking ahead, BS 6 lays the
            groundwork for further advancements in emissions standards, pushing
            the industry towards more sustainable and eco-friendly
            transportation solutions.
