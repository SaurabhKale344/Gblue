                    The Bharat Stage (BS) norms are emission standards introduced by the
                    Indian government to regulate the output of air pollutants from
                    vehicles. They play a crucial role in improving air quality and
                    reducing environmental damage caused by vehicular emissions.
                </p>
                <p class="article1-body-paragraph">
                    These standards, based on the European emission norms, aim to reduce
                    harmful pollutants released from vehicles and improve air quality.
                </p>
                <h2 class="article1-section-title">What are BS Norms?</h2>
                <p class="article1-body-paragraph">
                    BS norms are akin to the Euro emission standards followed in Europe.
                    They set permissible limits for pollutants like carbon monoxide
                    (CO), nitrogen oxides (NOx), hydrocarbons (HC), and particulate
                    matter (PM) emitted by vehicles. The higher the stage (e.g., BS4,
                    BS6), the stricter the limits on emissions.The Bharat Stage Norms
                    were first introduced in the year 2000, and the standards have been
                    progressively tightened over the years to reduce the emission of
                    harmful pollutants. Currently, the Bharat Stage 6 (BS-VI) norms are
                    being implemented nationwide, representing a significant leap
                    towards cleaner air in the country. The implementation of the BS-VI
                    norms has had a major impact on the automotive industry, requiring
                    manufacturers to make significant investments in technology and R&D
                    to meet the stricter emission requirements.

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The current emission standard in India requires that all new cars
                        produced, sold, and registered in India as of April 1, 2020,
                        comply with the BS-VI norms.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Particulate matter (PM 2.5) emissions from BS-VI engines range
                        from 20 to 40 micrograms per cubic meter.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The amount of sulphur released into the atmosphere by
                        BS-VI-compliant engines was reduced five times, from 50 ppm to 10
                        ppm.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        In diesel engines, nitrogen oxide emissions would be reduced by
                        70%, and in petrol engines, by 25%. Reduced fuel combustion would
                        result in less incomplete fuel combustion-related hydrocarbon
                        emission.

                        Three new types of equipment will be fixed in the vehicles by the
                        car manufacturer to reduce emissions:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF)</li>

                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Real Driving Emission (RDE) will be introduced in India for the
                        first time to measure a vehicle's emission under real conditions.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Onboard Diagnostics (OD) has been made compulsory for all
                        automobiles.

                </ul>

                <h2 class="article1-section-title">Significance of BS-VI Norms</h2>
                <p class="article1-body-paragraph">
                    The BS 6 (Bharat Stage 6) emission norms represent a significant
                    leap in India's efforts to combat air pollution and improve public
                    health.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The fact that the air quality in Indian cities is getting worse is
                        largely due to vehicle emissions. NOx, SO2, CO2, and particulate
                        matter emissions are negatively impacting people's health. Cities
                        like Delhi have PM2.5 levels more than six times higher than the
                        World Health Organization (WHO) recommends. These new regulations
                        will drastically lower vehicle emissions
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The difference between diesel and petrol emissions, wherein diesel
                        vehicles are permitted to emit more particulate matter and
                        nitrogen oxide, narrows under the BS-VI norms

                    All the technologies and emission control measures from earlier
                    Bharat Stage (BS) standards are still present in BS6, but they have
                    been significantly refined and enhanced to meet stricter emission
                    limits. Features such as catalytic converters, fuel injection
                    systems, and exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) systems, introduced in
                    earlier BS norms, continue to exist in BS6 with advanced versions
                    like diesel particulate filters (DPF) and selective catalytic
                    reduction (SCR) systems. Even if newer emission standards like BS7
                    are introduced, BS6 will still form the foundation, as the
                    fundamental principles of controlling vehicle emissions will remain
                    the same. Moreover, European and American regulatory bodies have
                    already indicated that with current technology, there is limited
                    room for further drastic improvements in emission control.

                <h2 class="article1-section-title">Conclusion</h2>
                <p class="article1-body-paragraph">
                    The implementation of BS 6 norms marks a critical advancement in
                    India ºs fight against air pollution. By significantly reducing
                    emissions of harmful pollutants such as NOx and particulate matter,
                    these norms have already contributed to cleaner air and improved
                    public health. The shift towards BS 6 has driven the adoption of
                    advanced vehicle technologies, setting a strong foundation for
                    future environmental policies. Looking ahead, BS 6 lays the
                    groundwork for further advancements in emissions standards, pushing
                    the industry towards more sustainable and eco-friendly
                    transportation solutions.
